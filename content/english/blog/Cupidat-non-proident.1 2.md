### What to look out for:

##### 1. Long random email account in the from address


Test As a rule of thumb, if it's a long address with random characters, it isn't legitimate.

An example would be an email from "Uber" with the address from "sadfadfue@online.io

> Note: Sometimes the actual address is hidden slightly behind the email account's display name. To show the actual address, there should be a little ^ arrow.

##### 2. Email looks different than usual trusted emails


If you've received an email that claims to be from a trusted source, such as your bank, but looks different than you are used to, be careful! This could be a phishing email. A phishing email tries to simulate an email from a trusted company, but in reality will steal your information.

If you have any suspicions at all, contact the company the email claims to be from to confirm that the email is legitimate!

> Note: You can check the from address in the same way mentioned in part 1!

##### 3. "Official" email, coming from a personal account

Another tell is an email from a company that is sent from a regular gmail/yahoo/aol account.

* Ex: Email from "Uber" with the email address "ubersupport123@gmail.com"

Note: You can check the from address in the same way mentioned in part 1!

##### 4. Unsolicited email asking for personal information

If you have received an email asking for any personal information, always be skeptical of it! This is especially true if the email is unsolicited. However, even if you've been in contact with a legitimate representative it's a good habit to confirm that the email is legitimate when they ask for personal information.

##### 5. Unsolicited email with links (phishing links)
